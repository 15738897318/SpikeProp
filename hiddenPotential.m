%the potential of a neuron at any time t is the sum of the 
%weighs multiplied by the spike-response function of t - t_i,
%where t_i is the post recent firing of that presynaptic neuron

%i - neuron pointer
%t - current time
%weights - weights on connections from input to the hidden nodes
%firetimes - matrix of fire times of all previous layer nodes
%thisFireTimes - the fire times of this node

%could also learn with delays but not doing so here - using weights
